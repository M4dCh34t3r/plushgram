# WELCOME TO PLUSHGRAM!
## What is this thing?
Plushgram is a photo and video sharing social networking service. The app allows users to upload "plush related" media that can be edited with filters and organized by hashtags and geographical tagging.

## Why is this a thing?
It all started as a joke trying to recreate Instagram's landing page for a bootcamp the author was taking a part in.

## How did you get those images?
Some of the files such as "plushgram-phone.png" and "plushgram-logo.png" were directly composed by the author based on Instagram's original designs. All the "stock images" used during the composition are listed bellow.
